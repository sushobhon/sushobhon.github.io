        "Have you ever wondered how your phone magically suggests the next word as you type? Or how chatbots string together coherent sentences? The secret lies in something called next token generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it this way: imagine telling a story one word at a time. After saying “The big,” what might come next? Perhaps “dog,” “house,” or “tree.” Next token generation teaches computers to do exactly this — predict the most likely word (or sometimes a piece of a word, called a “token”) that should follow the current sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, if you type “Thank you for your,” a next token generation model might suggest “help” as the most likely next word. It’s like having a super-smart autocomplete feature!\n",
        "\n",
        "In this blog, we’ll pull back the curtain to explore the fascinating techniques behind this technology. We’ll dive into some code to see how it works and compare our results with the leading transformer libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Get ready to explore the world of language prediction, where we’ll examine five popular methods that make next token generation possible: Greedy Search, Beam Search, Top-k Sampling, Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling, and Temperature Control. By the end, you’ll understand how machines learn to speak our language!\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "## Greedy Search\n",
        "When we pass text to a language model and ask it to predict the next word, it calculates the probability of each possible token given the input. The most natural and intuitive approach is to choose the token with the highest probability. This method of choosing the next token is called Greedy Search.\n",
        "\n",
        "In probabilistic terms, the `t` th token, given the tokens from `1` to `t-1`, will be\n",
